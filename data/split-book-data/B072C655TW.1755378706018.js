window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p><b>The <i>Sunday Times</i> Best Seller</b> </p> <p>James Acaster has been nominated for the Edinburgh Comedy Award five times and has appeared on prime-time TV shows like <i>Mock the Week</i>, <i>Live at the Apollo</i> and <i>Russell Howard's Stand Up Central</i>. </p> <p>But behind the fame and critical acclaim is a man perpetually getting into trouble. Whether it's disappointing a skydiving instructor mid-flight, hiding from thugs in a bush wearing a bright red dress, or annoying the Kettering Board Games club, a didgeridoo-playing conspiracy theorist and some bemused Christians, James is always finding new ways to embarrass himself. </p> <p>Appearing on Josh Widdicombe's radio show to recount these stories, the feature was christened 'James Acaster's classic scrapes'. Here, in his first book, James recounts these tales (including never-before-heard stories) in all their glorious stupidity. </p>";
