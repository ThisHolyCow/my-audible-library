The Earth follows shortly afterwards to make way for a new hyperspace bypass and his best friend has just announced that he's an alien. At this moment, they're hurtling through space with nothing but their towels and an innocuous-looking book inscribed with the big, friendly words: DON'T PANIC.<br> <br> The weekend has only just begun . . .<br> <br> <b>Follow Arthur Dent's galactic (mis)adventures in the rest of the trilogy with five parts: </b><b><i>The Restaurant at the End of the Universe, Life, the Universe and Everything, So Long, and Thanks for All the Fish, </i></b><b>and</b><b><i> Mostly Harmless</i></b><b>.</b></p>";
