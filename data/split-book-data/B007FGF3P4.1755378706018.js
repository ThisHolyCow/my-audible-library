window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>In <i>The Name of the Wind</i>, Patrick Rothfuss brings together elements from all the great fantasy writers, from George R. R. Martin to Robert Jordan, to create a thrilling and intricately spun story that will leave you breathless. </p> <p>I have stolen princesses back from sleeping barrow kings. I burned down the town of Trebon. I have spent the night with Felurian and left with both my sanity and my life. I was expelled from the university at a younger age than most people are allowed in. I tread paths by moonlight that others fear to speak of during day. I have talked to Gods, loved women, and written songs that make the minstrels weep. </p> <p> My name is Kvothe. You may have heard of me. </p> <p>So begins the tale of Kvothe - currently known as Kote, the unassuming innkeeper - from his childhood in a troupe of travelling players, through his years spent as a near feral orphan in a crime riddled city, to his daringly brazen yet successful bid to enter a difficult and dangerous school of magic. </p> <p>In these pages you will come to know Kvothe the notorious magician, the accomplished thief, the masterful musician, the dragon-slayer, the legend hunter, the lover, the thief and the infamous assassin. </p> <p><i>The Name of the Wind</i> is fantasy at its very best. </p> <p>Read by Rupert Degas. </p> <p><b>Please note this is now the entire audio of this book.<b></b></b></p>";
