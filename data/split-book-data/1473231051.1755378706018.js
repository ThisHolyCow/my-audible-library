Neither side has gained an advantage, and the threat of a betrayal by Dalinar's crafty ally Taravangian looms over every strategic move.<br> <br> Now, as new technological discoveries by Navani Kholin's scholars begin to change the face of the war, the enemy prepares a bold and dangerous operation. The arms race that follows will challenge the very core of the Radiant ideals, and potentially reveal the secrets of the ancient tower that was once the heart of their strength.<br> <br> At the same time that Kaladin Stormblessed must come to grips with his changing role within the Knights Radiant, his Windrunners face their own problem: As more and more deadly enemy Fused awaken to wage war, no more honorspren are willing to bond with humans to increase the number of Radiants. Adolin and Shallan must lead the coalition's envoy to the honorspren stronghold of Lasting Integrity and either convince the spren to join the cause against the evil god Odium, or personally face the storm of failure.<br> <br> <b>Other books by Brandon Sanderson</b><br> <br> <b>The Cosmere</b><br> <br> <b>The Stormlight Archive</b><br> <i>The Way of Kings</i><br> <i>Words of Radiance</i><br> <i>Edgedancer </i>(Novella)<br> <i>Oathbringer</i><br> <i>Rhythm of War</i><br> <i>Wind and Truth</i><br> <br> <b>The Mistborn Saga</b><br> <i>Mistborn</i><br> <i>The Well of Ascension</i><br> <i>The Hero of Ages</i><br> <i>The Alloy of Law</i><br> <i>Shadows of Self</i><br> <i>The Bands of Mourning</i><br> <i>The Lost Metal</i></p> <p><b>PLEASE NOTE: When you purchase this title, the accompanying PDF will be available in your Audible Library along with the audio.</b></p>";
