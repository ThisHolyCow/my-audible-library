Clarke Award, <i>Shards of Earth</i> is the first high-octane, far-future space adventure in Adrian Tchaikovsky's Final Architecture trilogy.<br><br>The series is read by Sophie Aldred (<i>Doctor Who</i>)</b><br><br>Idris has neither aged nor slept since they remade his mind in the war. And one of humanity’s heroes now scrapes by on a freelance salvage vessel, to avoid the attention of greater powers.<br><br>Eighty years ago, Earth was destroyed by an alien enemy. Many escaped, but millions more died. So mankind created enhanced humans ­such as Idris - who could communicate mind-to-mind with our aggressors. Then these ‘Architects’ simply disappeared and Idris and his kind became obsolete.<br><br>Now, Idris and his crew have something strange, abandoned in space. It’s clearly the work of the Architects – but are they really returning? And if so, why? Hunted by gangsters, cults and governments, Idris and his crew race across the galaxy as they search for answers. For they now possess something of incalculable value, and many would kill to obtain it.<br><br><b>‘Enthralling, epic, immersive and hugely intelligent’ – Stephen Baxter, author of the Xeelee Sequence</b><br><br><b>‘One of the most interesting and accomplished writers in speculative fiction’ – Christopher Paolini, author of <i>Fractal Noise</i></b><br><br><b>Praise for Adrian Tchaikovsky:</b><br><br>‘He writes incredibly enjoyable sci-fi, full of life and ideas’ – Patrick Ness<br><br>‘Thoughtful, sweeping space adventure’ – <i>SFX</i><br><br>‘Brilliant science fiction’ – James McAvoy<br></p>";
