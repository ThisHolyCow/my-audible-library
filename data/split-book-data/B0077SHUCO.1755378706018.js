window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>The complete magisterial history of the greatest and most terrible event in history, from one of the finest historians of the Second World War. This shows the impact of war upon hundreds of millions of people around the world - soldiers, sailors and airmen; housewives, farm workers and children. </p> <p>Reflecting Max Hastings' 35 years of research on World War II, <i>All Hell Let Loose</i> describes the course of events but focuses chiefly upon human experience. There are vivid descriptions of the tragedies and triumphs of a host of ordinary people, in uniform and out of it, in an 'everyman's story'. </p> <p><b>This is now the entire audiobook, not in two parts.</b></p>";
