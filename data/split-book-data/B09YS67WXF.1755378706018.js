window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>The madness, absurdity, and utter chaos of being a parent from the hosts of the no.1 smash hit podcast.</p> <p>Read, improvised and embellished by Rob and Josh, with special guest appearances by their wives Rose and Lou, podcast producer Michael and Rob's parents Sue and Dave. </p> <p><i>What's it really like to be a parent?</i> And how come no one ever warned Rob or Josh of the sheer mind-bending, world-altering, sleep-depriving, sick-covering, tear-inducing, snot-wiping, bore-inspiring, 4am-relationship-straining brutality of it all? And if they did, why can't they remember it (or remember anything else, for that matter)?</p> <p>And just when they thought it couldn't get any harder, why didn't anyone warn them about the slices of unmatched euphoric joy and pride that occasionally come piercing through, drenching you in unbridled happiness in much the same way a badly burped baby drenches you in milk-sick?</p> <p>Join Josh and Rob as they share the challenges and madness of their parenting journeys with lashings of empathy and extra helpings of laughs. Filled with all the things they never tell you at antenatal classes, <i>Parenting Hell</i> is a beguiling mixture of humour, rumination and conversation for prospective parents, new parents, old parents and never-to-be parents alike.</p>";
