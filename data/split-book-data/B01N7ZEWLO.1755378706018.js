window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p><b>The Stormlight Archive saga continues in </b><b><i>Oathbringer</i></b><b>, the incredible third book in Brandon Sanderson's #1 </b><b><i>New York Times</i></b><b> bestselling series.</b><br> <br> The Alethi armies commanded by Dalinar Kholin won a fleeting victory at a terrible cost: The enemy Parshendi summoned the violent Everstorm, and now its destruction sweeps the world and its passing awakens the once peaceful and subservient parshmen to the true horror of their millennia-long enslavement by humans. While on a desperate flight to warn his family of the threat, Kaladin Stormblessed must come to grips with the fact that their newly kindled anger may be wholly justified.<br> <br> Nestled in the mountains high above the storms, in the tower city of Urithiru, Shallan Davar investigates the wonders of the ancient stronghold of the Knights Radiant and unearths the dark secrets lurking in its depths. And Dalinar realizes that his holy mission to unite his homeland of Alethkar was too narrow in scope. Unless all the nations of Roshar can put Dalinar's blood-soaked past aside and stand together - and unless Dalinar himself can confront that past - even the restoration of the Knights Radiant will not avert the end of civilization.<br> <br> <b>Other books by Brandon Sanderson</b><br> <br> <b>The Cosmere</b><br> <br> <b>The Stormlight Archive</b><br> <i>The Way of Kings</i><br> <i>Words of Radiance</i><br> <i>Edgedancer </i>(Novella)<br> <i>Oathbringer</i><br> <i>Rhythm of War</i><br> <i>Wind and Truth</i><br> <br> <b>The Mistborn Saga</b><br> <i>Mistborn</i><br> <i>The Well of Ascension</i><br> <i>The Hero of Ages</i><br> <i>The Alloy of Law</i><br> <i>Shadows of Self</i><br> <i>The Bands of Mourning</i><br> <i>The Lost Metal</i></p> <p><b>PLEASE NOTE: When you purchase this title, the accompanying PDF will be available in your Audible Library along with the audio.</b></p>";
